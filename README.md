**tldr;**  We propose a neural news recommendation model that incorporates expressed emotions within news articles to improve recommendation performance. Our approach disentangles semantic and emotional modeling of news articles and users, using textual content for semantic representation and emotions for emotional representation. Offline experiments on a real-world dataset show our approach outperforms non-emotion-aware solutions significantly. We plan to investigate online performance and explainability/explorability of our approach in the future.
